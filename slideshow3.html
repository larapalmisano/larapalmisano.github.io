    <h4><em>2011</em> Gaza: Against steep odds children break world records</h4>

    <div style="max-width: 780px;">
    <p>
        Defying intimidation when unknown assailants attacked their summer camp run by the 
        United Nations in 2011, children in Gaza broke a total of four Guinness World Records 
        as they participated in events organized by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency 
        for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Since 1950, UNRWA has been providing 
        assistance and protection to nearly 5.2 million registered Palestine refugees through 
        health care, education, social services, infrastructure and emergency support, including 
        in times of armed conflict.
