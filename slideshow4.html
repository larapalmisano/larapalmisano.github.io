    <p>
        Since 2003, conflict in Sudan’s Darfur region between government forces and armed rebel
        groups has taken a major toll on civilians, leaving thousands dead and millions displaced. 
        In 2007, the Security Council established the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur
        (UNAMID), the largest-ever peacekeeping operation, mandated to protect civilians and support 
        the peace process in the region. In 2012, the UN applauded a milestone in the ongoing peace 
        process, the inauguration of the Darfur Regional Authority, a body intended to facilitate 
        peace in the war-torn region.
