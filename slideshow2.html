    <h4><em>2011</em> Indigenous peoples: Overcoming discrimination and injustice</h4>

    <div style="max-width: 780px;">
    <p>
        The world's 370 million indigenous identify themselves as distinct peoples with their own social, 
        economic and political systems. Effective advocates for their rights, they have engaged the 
        United Nations since its foundation to build solidarity for their centuries-old struggles to 
        overcome injustice and discrimination. Progress has been made incrementally through, among 
        other mechanisms, the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues established in 2000. The 
        landmark UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the General Assembly 
        in 2007, sets out minimum standards for their survival, dignity and well-being.
