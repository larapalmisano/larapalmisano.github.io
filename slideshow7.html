    <h4><em>2014</em> Syria conflict: UN appeals for humanitarian access to millions of people trapped by fighting</h4>

        Throughout the conflict in Syria, which in its fifth year has killed more than 200,000 people and forced 
        almost half the population to flee their homes, humanitarian access to meet the needs of civilians 
        trapped by the fighting has been a key concern for the United Nations. In 2014, as peace talks to 
        end the conflict stalled, UN officials appealed multiple times to both sides to allow the delivery 
        of relief aid, but with limited success.

        In January, the UN agency tasked with protecting Palestinian refugees throughout the Middle East, 
        known as UNRWA, was permitted to deliver only small quantities of food aid to the 18,000 
        malnourished residents living in the besieged Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk in Syria.
