        In 2013, while on a visit to Warsaw, Poland, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (right) visited 
        the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau where more than a million Jews and members 
        of other minorities perished during World War II. Warning that the world must never forget, 
        deny or downplay the Holocaust, Ban said: “I stand in disbelief before the gas chambers and
        crematorium, and shudder at the cruelty of those who designed this death factory.” Hatred
        and persecution have not ended, he cautioned, adding that, in Europe and elsewhere, migrants 
        and minorities face rising discrimination. “We must remain ever on our guard. And we must do 
        more, far more, to promote equality and fundamental freedoms,” he said.
