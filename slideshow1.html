    <h4><em>2010</em> Advancing nuclear disarmament for a safer world</h4>
    <div style="max-width: 780px;">
    <p>
        Nuclear arms are the most dangerous weapons on Earth - just one is capable of inflicting 
        catastrophic harm to people and the environment. Despite an array of international 
        agreements aimed at reducing nuclear arsenals, the world's 22,000 existing nuclear 
        weapons continue to pose a threat to peace and security. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, 
        who has placed nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation high on the UN agenda, has warned 
        that bold steps toward a nuclear-weapons-free world have stalled, leading to mounting 
        tensions between States and a return to Cold War mentalities.
