    <h4><em>2014</em> International community supports West Africa in response to Ebola crisis</h4>

    <div style="max-width: 780px;">
    <p>
        In 2014, an unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola virus devastated the populations and 
        economies in West Africa. Despite efforts by the United Nations and its partners to 
        bolster government response to the emergency, the epidemic affected more than 27,000 
        people, killing more than 11,000 – mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – and 
        eroded achievements in the areas of peace and development, disrupted health, education 
        and social services, and set back major economic sectors such as agriculture, mining, 
        trade and tourism. In July 2015, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convened an international 
        conference to help mobilize resources to support affected countries on their path to recovery.
